# Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Challenge - Day 22: Center Line Class
# COMPLETELY NEW ADDITION - Creates dotted center line dividing court sides
# This class was NOT in the original Angela Yu implementation

class CenterLine(Turtle):
    """
    COMPLETELY NEW CLASS - Not in original Angela Yu code

    Center Line class that draws a dotted line down the middle of the screen
    Adds professional tennis/pong court appearance to the game
    Inherits from Turtle class for drawing capabilities

    WHY ADDED:
    - Professional sports games have court dividers
    - Visual separation between player sides
    - Makes the game look more polished and complete
    - Follows real pong/tennis court design

        """
        NEW METHOD: Draw the dotted center line from top to bottom of screen
        Creates alternating pattern of dots and gaps

        TECHNIQUE USED:
        - Move turtle to top center of screen
        - Draw dot (pen down, move forward, pen up)
        - Create gap (pen up, move forward)
        - Repeat until bottom of screen reached

# WHY THIS CLASS WAS ADDED TO ANGELA YU'S ORIGINAL CODE:
#
# ORIGINAL ANGELA YU PONG (Day 22):
# - Black screen with white paddles and ball
# - Simple, functional game
# - No visual court elements
# - Focus on core game mechanics
#
# ENHANCEMENT REASONING:
# 1. üéæ REALISM: Real pong/tennis courts have center dividers
# 2. üëÅÔ∏è VISUAL APPEAL: Makes the game look more professional
# 3. üéÆ USER EXPERIENCE: Clear visual separation between player sides
# 4. üèÜ POLISH: Adds that "finished game" feel
# 5. üìö LEARNING: Demonstrates turtle graphics drawing techniques
#
# TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
# - Uses turtle's penup()/pendown() for dotted pattern
# - Calculates screen boundaries automatically
# - Draws from top to bottom in single pass
# - Uses constants for easy customization
#
# INTEGRATION WITH ORIGINAL CODE:
# - Called once during game setup in main.py
# - Doesn't interfere with game mechanics
# - Pure visual enhancement - no gameplay impact
# - Maintains Angela Yu's simple class structure
#
# This addition transforms the basic black screen into a proper
# pong court while preserving all of Angela Yu's core teaching
# concepts and game mechanics!
